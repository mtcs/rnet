  RNet is a realistic random network generator. It generates a social network from
  some statistical parameters. It deliberately assign communities to each node to 
  achieve realistic social behavior.

  RNet is __highly flexible__, it can accept several parameters. Besides the size of
  the generated network, it also accepts: outdegree, indegree and community size
  probability distributions, probability of connecting inside a node community and
  probability of connecting a node to a totally random node. These parameters make
  possible to generate a large variety of networks with much smaller restrictions
  than other generators.

  RNet is also __very fast__, it is possible to generate graphs with millions of
  vertices in matter of seconds! It uses multithreading to better explore modern CPU
  power.


Compilation
-----------


- Unux/Linux

-- Required 

GCC 	- The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a compiler system produced by the
	GNU Project supporting various programming languages. GCC is a key
	component of the GNU toolchain.

OpenMP  - Support is required from the compiler, if you wish to use other compiler
	make sure it has OpenMP support.
	
CMake 	- Cmake is a cross-platform free software program for managing the build
        process of software using a compiler-independent method.

-- Optional:

CCMake	- The "ccmake" executable is the CMake curses interface.


-- Commands:

# cd rnet/build
# cmake ../src
# make -j4
# ./rnet


- Mac OS:

Calling gcc in the command line actually calls for XCode's LLVM, which uses clang 
and does not currently support openMP. To compile you must first download a working 
version of gcc (with homebrew?) and set cmake to work with it: 

CC=[path-to-gcc] CXX=[path-to-g++] cmake ../src


- Windows:

1) Verify if MinGW in in the PATH (to put it there follow the instructions in
"Environment Settings" in [http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started]).

2) If you never used OpenMP with MinGW, you will also need to install OpenMP
libraries. To do so, open the MonGW installation manager, go to  "All Packages >
MinGW > MinGW Base System" and install "mingw32-libgomp" and "mingw32-pthreads-w32".

3) One way to configure the RNet CMake is to go to CMake GUI, open
configuration menu, select "MSYS Makefiles" option on the dropdown and "Specify
native compilers" in the window list. After, click "Next", fill paths to GCC and G++
(ex: C:/MinGW/bin/gcc.exe). Than, hit "Finish" to configure CMake.

4) Hit the "Generate" button to generate Makefile.

5) To compile RNet, go to MSYS, browse the build directory and execute "make"
("mingw32-make" will not work properly due to POSIX path incompatibility:
[http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.make.windows/month=20050601]).
